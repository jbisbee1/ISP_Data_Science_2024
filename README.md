## Overview
The target audience is someone who is interested in Data Science, but who has no prior experience. The class is designed to be application-forward -- demonstrating what you can do with the tools of data science in the hopes of motivating and encouraging students to go deeper and further. As an introductory class with no prerequisites, the statistical and programming fundamentals behind what we do is only briefly mentioned; the goal is to provide a sense of what can be done with data science rather than to provide a comprehensive foundation on a smaller set of topics. The contents of this repository represent a work-in-progress and revisions and edits are likely frequent.

The main text for the course is "R For Data Science" which can accessed free online [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html). 

Students are expected to have a free ChatGPT account which can be accessed [here](https://chat.openai.com/)

## Required Applications

### Campuswire
I have set up a Campuswire workspace for our use this semester to help us better communicate with each other and the TAs. You will need to create an account and join our workspace by following [this link](https://campuswire.com/p/GB39C8310) and using the secret pin number provided in the email from Professor Bisbee.

Here is the list of channels you should see upon joining the Campuswire workspace:

- **Class feed**: A space to post questions and respond to other posts.

- **#announcements**: A space for all course announcements.
	
- **#general**: A space for you to share and discuss stories you've seen in the news or on social media that are relevant to our class.

- **Calendar**: A calendar containing all lectures, due dates, office hours, and labs.

- **Files**: A space for course materials (**NOT USED. VISIT GITHUB INSTEAD.**)

- **Grades**: A space for grades
	
### GitHub
I have created a [`GitHub`](https://github.com/jbisbee1/ISP_Data_Science_2024) repository to prepare and share all course-related content. This very syllabus is available as the repository's README and all links below are connected to the appropriate folders, sub-folders, and files in this repository. 

You are expected to adopt the following workflow for this class:

1. Prior to each lecture, download the appropriate `.Rmd` file, open it in `RStudio`, and read through it. **This is your primary homework assignment!** As you work through it, try to tweak some of the code and answer the toy examples where provided. Each time you make a change, click the `knit` button in `RStudio` to see if everything still loads.
	
2. During each lecture, create a new `.Rmd` file to take notes in. As with the homework, you should be tweaking and adjusting things on your own, extending your learning beyond what is covered in lecture.
	
3. After each lecture, tweak the notes `.Rmd` file further to test out new ideas that you come up with which were not covered in class. Each lecture's slides will be made available as `PDF` for you use to help you review. Thinking creatively about how to modify and extend what we do together might mean you already guess some of the exam questions!

## Evaluation & Responsibilities

You will be assigned problem sets which will test your ability to apply what you've learned in class, and to think creatively about your own data science ideas. These problem sets are assigned twice per week, one on Monday and the other on Thursday. Monday's You are welcome to collaborate on these problem sets, and are encouraged to ask questions on the **Class feed** on `Campuswire`.

There are also two exams. The first is a mid-term exam that is scheduled for July 11th and will take place in class. The second is a cumulative final exam that will take place in class on July 25th.

The final grade is the sum of total points defined as follows:

- **Problem sets:** 6 in total, each worth 10 points.
- **Exams:** Midterm and final. The midterm is worth 15 points, and the final worth 20 points. These are in-class exams.
- **Attendance:** You are expected to attend lecture, although are given two "freebies" which will not count toward your final grade. Each class is worth 0.36 points, for a total of 5 points.

Letter grades are determined as per the standard SNU grading system, reproduced below:

- A+: 97+
- A: 94-96
- A-: 90-93
- B+: 87-89
- B: 84-86
- B-: 80-83
- C+: 77-79
- C: 74-76
- C-: 70-73
- D+: 67-69
- D: 64-66
- D-: 60-63
- F: <60

## Course Policies

### Problem Set Submissions

Problem sets must be emailed to TA Eun Ji Kim prior to the lecture at which they are due. They must be emailed **formatted as a PDF**. To do this, please follow the instructions laid out in the [helper problem set 0](https://github.com/jbisbee1/ISP_Data_Science_2024/blob/main/Psets/ISP_pset_0_HELPER.pdf), which can be found here: https://github.com/jbisbee1/ISP_Data_Science_2024/blob/main/Psets/ISP_pset_0_HELPER.pdf

### Late Assignments

Given the truncated duration of the summer session, any problem set that is not submitted on time will not be graded.

### Cell Phones, Laptops, Tablets, etc.

You are expected to bring your laptop to class in order to work through the `.Rmd` file during the lecture. These `.Rmd` files will be posted to the GitHub repository at least 24 hours prior to the lecture. Students are encouraged to download these files and work through them prior to class.

You are asked to silence your cell phone / tablet / smart watch before class begins.

### Academic Honor Code

Collaboration is the heart of data science, but your work on your assignments should be your own. Please be careful not to plagiarize. 

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, altering graded examinations for additional credit, having another person take an examination for you, falsification of results, or facilitating academic dishonesty or as further specified in the university policy found at the website above. These and other forms of cheating are all potentially grounds for penalties including failure of the assignment or the course, as well as program- or university-level disciplinary action.

ChatGPT and related Large Language Models (LLMs) are essential tools in the data scientist's toolkit, and acceptable resources for completing the assignments and learning concepts at a deeper level. However, graded assignments cannot be generated purely by these tools. All assignments must include a log of the ChatGPT prompts and resulting output used to complete the assignment.

### Diversity Statement

Data science is, at its core, about thinking creatively to answer challenging questions. Creative thinking requires exposure to different perspectives, which are themselves borne of diverse experiences. I value diversity in all its forms including age, ability or disability, ethnicity, national origin, race, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, and family and marital status. I expect that all students participating in this class will respect differences and strive to understand how other peoples' perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may be different from their own.

### Religious Holidays
The observance of religious holidays (activities observed by a religious group of which a student is a member) and cultural practices are an important reflection of diversity. As your instructor, I am committed to providing equivalent educational opportunities to students of all belief systems. At the beginning of the semester, you should review the course requirements to identify foreseeable conflicts with assignments, exams, or other required attendance. If at all possible, please contact me within the first two weeks of the first class meeting to allow time for us to discuss and make fair and reasonable adjustments to the schedule and/or tasks.
